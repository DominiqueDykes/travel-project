            <h2>Why Jamaica?</h2>
            <h3>The Culture, Tradition, and More!</h3>
            <p>
              The pull of Jamaica's alluring island is far more than their sparkling
            blue waters and incredible mountainous terrain. The food is tantalizing
            and the weather is perfect, but it is the charm of the people who will
            keep you coming back for more. No matter what hardships may hide beneath
            the surface, Jamaicans find a way to smile, dance, and be merry as they 
            go about their days.
            </p>
            <p>
              The history of Jamaica over the past 500 years has been marked by the
               courage of the Jamaican people in their triumphant struggle for freedom 
               and justice and by their unrelenting resistance and determination in the 
               face of adversity and discrimination. Modern Jamaica is built on a historical 
               legacy of genocide perpetrated against the islandâ€™s indigenous peoples, on the 
               experience of over three hundred years of slavery and oppression suffered by the 
               Jamaicans of African origin and on the interplay between Europe, Africa, Asia and 
               the Middle East in the building of a proud, free and progressive nation in the 
               heart of the Caribbean.
